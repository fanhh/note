To address this problem, we first need to understand the key concepts involved:

1. **Lambertian Surface**: A Lambertian object reflects light equally in all directions. The intensity of the light reflected by a Lambertian surface is directly proportional to the cosine of the angle between the light source direction and the normal to the surface.

2. **Light Source Direction**: Given as \(s = [0\; 1]^T\), indicating that the light is coming from the direction parallel to the y-axis.

3. **Unit Normal at Point \(p\)** on the circle: Given as \(n(\theta) = [\cos(\theta)\; \sin(\theta)]^T\), where \(\theta\) is the angle with the x-axis.

4. **Albedo Variation**: The albedo (reflectivity) of the surface varies with \(\theta\) as \(a(\theta) = \cos(\theta)\).

5. **Observation Direction**: The camera observes the surface from the same direction as the light source, which is \(s = [0\; 1]^T\).

### a. Expression for Image Intensity

The image intensity \(I(\theta)\) for a Lambertian surface under a distant light source is given by the Lambertian reflectance model:

\[
I(\theta) = \rho \cdot L \cdot \max(0, n(\theta) \cdot s)
\]

where:
- \(\rho\) is the albedo of the surface, which in this case is \(a(\theta) = \cos(\theta)\).
- \(L\) is the intensity of the incoming light, which we can assume to be constant and normalize to 1 for simplicity.
- \(n(\theta) \cdot s\) is the dot product between the surface normal \(n(\theta)\) and the light source direction \(s\), representing the cosine of the angle between these two vectors.

Given \(n(\theta) = [\cos(\theta)\; \sin(\theta)]^T\) and \(s = [0\; 1]^T\), the dot product \(n(\theta) \cdot s = \sin(\theta)\).

Thus, the image intensity as a function of \(\theta\) is:

\[
I(\theta) = \cos(\theta) \cdot \max(0, \sin(\theta))
\]

### b. Brightest Intensity Value of \(\theta\)

To find the value of \(\theta\) where the intensity is brightest, we consider the expression for \(I(\theta)\). Since both \(\cos(\theta)\) and \(\sin(\theta)\) are involved, and we're considering \(\theta\) from \(-90^\circ\) to \(90^\circ\), the intensity will be brightest when both \(\cos(\theta)\) and \(\sin(\theta)\) are positive and as large as possible. This occurs at:

\[
\theta = 45^\circ
\]

At this angle, \(\sin(\theta) = \cos(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), making both factors in the expression for \(I(\theta)\) positive and maximally contributing to the intensity (given the constraints of the problem). Thus, the intensity is brightest at \(\theta = 45^\circ\), where the surface normal is at a \(45^\circ\) angle to both the x-axis and the direction of the light source/camera.
